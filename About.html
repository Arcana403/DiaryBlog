		<p><b>Hello, my name is Philip Angelo Y. Dulva.</b></p>
		<p>Being born on April 3, 2001, I am now currently 15 years old. And in that 15 years of my life I have experienced various things. I have learned from this experiences and continue to live on my life. I have made this blog to write everything that had transpired in those fifteen years. Currently I am attending high school and I'd say this would be the most memorable stage of my life. I have tons of memories that I already want to cherish in this school even if I am still halfway from graduating out of here.</p>
		<p>If you want to know something about me, I'd say I'm a typical <a href="Extra/Anime.html">anime/manga</a> fan. I watch anime and have watched tons of them already. I also read manga especially those of the series that I like. I have been watching anime for as long as I have been in high school. You could say that anime is something I'll never get tired of even as I grow up. Another one of my hobbies would be is that I like to read books/novels. No matter what the genre is, I'll be finishing that book in just one seating. Well I do have a preferred genre of books and that would be those love stories you can commonly find in wattpad. If you don't know, I also like puzzles and games that would make your head want to explode. If ever I see a book full of IQ tests and riddles, I always get the urge to just buy it and worry about the money afterwards. Ever since I was a litte kid, I have been solving this problems and you could say maybe this is one reason on why I am smart.</p>
		<p>You could say I'm a random person. Sometimes serious, sometimes crazy is who I am. If you know me well, then you can say I'm pretty friendly and prefers to have friends that are girls rather than boys. Someone from a while back had told me that I am sweet and hilarious though I don't really believe it. I'm a bookworm but not a bookworm for books that are used for studying.</p>
		<p>Well I guess that's all you need to know about me. Enjoy my blog.</p>
