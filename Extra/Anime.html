		<p>Hello. Hello. Hello. Philip here and I'm putting an extra page in my blog dedicated to the animes that I have watched already. Anime is so nice, I'll never grow tired of it. Sometimes I just wish that I have fast and free internet all the time so I can watch new anime and read manga.</p>

		<h1 class="title">The World God Only Knows (Anime and Manga)</h1>
		<p class="plot">Keima Katsuragi, known online as the legendary "God of Conquest," can conquer any girl's heart—in dating sim games, at least. In reality, he opts for the two-dimensional world of gaming over real life because he is an unhealthily obsessed otaku of galge games (a type of Japanese video game centered on interactions with attractive girls).<br>When he arrogantly accepts an anonymous offer to prove his supremacy at dating sim games, Keima is misled into aiding a naïve and impish demon from hell named Elucia "Elsie" de Lute Ima with her mission: retrieving runaway evil spirits who have escaped from hell and scattered themselves throughout the human world. Keima discovers that the only way to capture these spirits is to conquer what he hates the most: the unpredictable hearts of three-dimensional girls! Shackled to Elsie via a deadly collar, Keima now has his title of "God of Conquest" put to the ultimate test as he is forced to navigate through the hearts of a multitude of real-life girls.</p>

		<p class="comment">I'd thought I would see guns but no. Sabagebu is a really fun anime to watch because of its humor. The girls imaginations are so vivid that you'd think that their gun fights are seriously happeening.</p>

		<p class="comment">I watched all the seasons. The anime was kinda boring at first unless you're really into it. It was kind of like Tokyo Ghoul. The last season's ending was not satisfying.</p>

		<h1 class="title">Shingeki no Kyojin</h1>
		<p class="plot">Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.<br>After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls.

		<p class="comment">The first scene I watched was Eren's mother getting eaten and I seriously felt that part. That was one terrifying scene. I want a season 2.</p>

The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.<br>Based on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls' inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.</p>

		<p class="comment">I want to live there. I want the siblings intelligence. Being an expert in all kinds of games in a world where games is everything, that would be nice.</p>

However, the school segregates the students based on their entrance exam scores, with the best students (known as "Blooms") being assigned to First Course and the worst students (known as "Weeds") being assigned to the Second Course. Due to the exams not accounting for his talents, Tatsuya is placed in the Second Course, making him an irregular student within the magic high school.</p>
		<p class="comment">Madhouse, why you no make season 2. The "Irregular at Magic High School" has a good plotline and I would want to discover more things about the main characters. People would say the anime sucks but its only because they didn't put good things in it. The anime is pretty much only a teaser for the upcoming volumes in the light novel.</p>

In spite of this, they still throw all their energy into solving these worries.</p>
		<p class="comment">SKET Dance is an anime I recommend. A combination of humor, mystery, romance, sadness and parody. SKET Dance is fun anime to watch. They would just do random things usually but the anime will sometimes show the sad past of the three main characters.</p>
